    * Each time block allows user to enter any event description and save it against the time block in the local storage.

    * The current time block is marked as red colour and editable.

    * The past time blocks are marked as grey colour and are not editable.

    * The future time blocks are marked as green colour and are editable.

    * When the page is refreshed all the saved events are displayed in the relevant time blocks.
